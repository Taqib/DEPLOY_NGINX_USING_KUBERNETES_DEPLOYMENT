A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction over a ReplicaSet that provides additional functionality and features to manage the lifecycle of applications more effectively. It manages a set of identical pods, ensuring they run and scale as needed.

Deployment offers a more sophisticated way to manage the entire lifecycle of those pods, including updates, rollbacks, and scaling, providing a higher level of abstraction and more powerful features.
